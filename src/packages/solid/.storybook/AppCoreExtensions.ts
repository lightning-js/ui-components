// Here we just re-export everything from the shared location.
export { default } from '../../../shared/AppCoreExtensions.js';

// Workaround: Originally `preview.tsx` was importing the shared `AppCoreExtensions.ts`
// file directly via the importChunkUrl plugin, but that is currently causing an
// issue with the storybook-static build where the preview does not load.
// The error preventing the preview from loading is due to the app trying to load
// Storybook's `sb-preview/runtime.js` file from the wrong relative location.
// But we're not sure how the plugin is causing that issue.
// This is a workaround until we have time to figure out what is causing the
// root issue.
